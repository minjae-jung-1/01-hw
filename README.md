In this homework we learned and applied semantic tags of html. 
During this assignment we separated the html into 3 main parts; Head , body, footer.
Within the head we put all our external references and libraries. Essentially the resources we need for loading the website.
The body contained a header with general information and a nav bar right after it for key links to the information in the body.
The html is then separated in to a main and an aside. The main containing the important content of the page followed by the aside with less important information. Each section has an id in order to link proper css to create a more simple and efficent code.
